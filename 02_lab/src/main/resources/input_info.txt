- Number of nodes (n): integer //nodes will be assigned ID from 0 to n-1
- Is at least one node's clockCounter higher than 0? string "y" for yes or "n" for no
if previously "y":
	- List of clockCounters of nodes: integers separated by ","
- Is there a node already in critical section?: string "y" for yes or "n" for no
if previously "y":
	- ID of node in critical section: int
	- Does this node have any stored nodes to whom did not award goAhead yet? y/n
if previously "y":
	- List of IDs of nodes that node in critical section got request for approval from: integers separated by ","
- Number of nodes (w) waiting for critical section that already asked for permission: int
if number w>1:
for i in range(w):
	- Node ID: int
	- ClockCounter when node requested critical section: int
	- Does this node have any stored nodes to whom did not award goAhead yet? (y/n)
	- List of integers corresponding to IDs of stored nodes (they requested goahead but it was not given to them by this node: int
	- List of integers corresponding to approvals: 1 and 0 integers separated by "," //for each node (for idx of requesting node there is value "1") from network either approval was obtained = 1 in the index corresponding to ID of Node that gave the approval or was not obtained = 0
- Requests that will be made in the network:
	- as two integers: integer clockCounter and integer node ID separated by ","

Example:
//number of nodes in the network
5

//at least one clockCounter is different from 0
y

//clockCounters of each node 	
4,10,7,4,5 

//yes there is a node in critical section
y

//ID of node in critical section	
1	

//does this node have any stored nodes to whom did not award goAhead?
y

//list of nodes that requested approval from node while in critical section
4,2

//number of nodes waiting for entering critical section	
2	

//node ID of the first node waiting for entering critical section
4

//clockCounter when node with ID 4 requested entering critical section
5

//does this node have any stored nodes to whom did not award goAhead?
y

//List of integers corresponding to IDs of stored nodes
2,	

//list of integers corresponding to approvals obtained by node with ID 4 waiting for entering critical section (on idx 4 (indexing from zero) 1 is written because ID of node is 4
1,0,1,1,1	

//node ID of the second node waiting for entering critical section
2

//clockCounter when node with ID 2 requested entering critical section
7

//does this node have any stored nodes to whom did not award goAhead?
n

//list of integers corresponding to approvals obtained by node with ID 2 waiting for entering critical section (on idx 2 (indexing from zero) 1 is written because ID of node is 2

//Requests
//request to enter critical section made by node with ID 0 and timeStampCounter 12
